                    Figma was used to collaboratively design the look and functionality of the bootcamp website prototype. Figma is a web application used to design websites as a team. As the main goal is a web application, this tool was used by all team members to develop a functional prototype of the website prior to the programming stage

                    I worked with the team to determine functionality requirements of the website, the design of the database, and inspirations to guide towards the finished prototype in Figma. This task was done as a team with the other WIL students and a project champion (Coding Labs Staff) reviewing and providing feedback. This was assigned by the staff at Coding Labs as part of their own processes and introduced in the bootcamp before using it for designing the website.

                    Through the Figma application we successfully developed the prototype for the website as required by Coding Labs. This prototype was finished in time to delve into the programming stage to further develop the project. While the website design was successful, I would have liked to see the project extend to the design of the game interface. Even though that aspect of the game was not a goal at this stage, I can certainly see the benefit in continuing to use Figma process to develop the User Interface for the game in the next stages of development.

                    Figma was amazing to learn and develop collaboratively the process of designing a website and its functionality. The skills learnt through this process have helped a lot towards learning the process of designing the visual aspects of a website. In the future when working on similar tasks, I would like to come into the project with more knowledge in user experience and design concepts to make the design look better. I will also practise the Figma application to improve my efficiency to create better looking prototypes at a faster pace.

                    As part of the end goal of the project is to have an interactive game, having a game available on the website was a requirement. The Unity3d Engine was chosen for this purpose as the webGL build option allowed for integration into a website. For this stage of development, the game required basic functionality and ability to interact with the website, including being able to load, save, send, and receive messages between the two. While required for the project, the learning and knowledge behind this task was not provided by Coding Labs as this was working towards a new concept, although assistance was provided where possible.

                    For this task my goal was to have the functional game meet the requirements and be implemented into the website, meeting the requirements set by Coding Labs to integrate into their standards. Built using the Unity3D engine, I would develop the internal game functions as well as the website code to integrate it. A simple scenario was created to simulate gameplay in a manner that shows that it meets the requirements for gameplay, and interaction with the website.

                    I was able to accomplish my task, and develop a game integrated with a website. While it was hard than I originally expected, I was able to accomplish the goals and meet the requirements set for me. A lot had to be changed to integrate the game into the framework Coding Labs uses, as the default build in Unity3d did not support the integration straight out of the box. With the successful integration, the opportunity for future similar projects is proven possible.

                    I have learned how to a Unitu3D game build interacts with the website, including save and loading data, applying that data to reflect in the game, and how to manage a database in relation to a game running on the webpage. While I am happy with the process and time this task took me, it is because this was a new process that I knew little about and online there was little documentation. If I were to repeat this process again on another project, I would like to have this process well documented to allow for a significantly faster development cycle.                </p>
