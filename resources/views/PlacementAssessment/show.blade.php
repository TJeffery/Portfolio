                    My time with Coding Labs was spent in two stages. First was working through a bootcamp to improve my knowledge and skills web development as an applicable skill for future employment. The skills learnt in the bootcamp went from early concept to from designing to implementation. Utilizing Figma and PHP larval, these skills were implemented to develop a personal portfolio as evidence of skills learnt. The second stage moved onto a collaborative development, where the goal is to re-design the bootcamp into an interactive online game to teach the skills.  This followed the same process as the bootcamp itself except with a collaborative workflow including myself, and the other WIL students under the supervision of our project champion. My focus during the development stages was the integration of a working game into the website, combining Unity3D, Laravel, and Vue. This integration was successful and provides a proof of concept for the continuation of the project in the near future.

                    From my experiences with Coding Labs, I learnt the process of collaborating with a team in a live scenario. Amongst my time there I learnt the most important aspect of collaboration is clarity, transparency, and consistency. By keeping consistent transparency with the team, we were able to work towards solutions together and keep our work aligned to the same goal. Typically, in the past I had focused more on my own work, while in teams our communication was vague, and we would wait longer periods before combining/ discussing our work. While working closely with my co-workers, maintaining clarity between us was important. By working together to solve issues we could work through issues with ease. Through the friendly and inviting work environment, this process was encouraged, and we kept clarity through our work.

                <p class="font-l text-sky-100">
                    The first stage (follow the bootcamp) was beneficial as it gave us a chance to re-enforce skills we have learnt before, while giving us time to ease into the work and team environment, rather than throwing us full speed into the work This ease helped a lot with transitioning from class work while developing friendly relationships with co-workers.
                </p>
                <p class="font-l text-sky-100">
                    The second stage (re-vamp the bootcamp) enforced collaboration on a real project. This gave us the chance to put what we have learnt into action, while also introducing new framework and problems to work through. Because we had already become familiar with each other we were able to rapidly adapt to changes in the project and collaborate effectively.

                    The most important thing I have taken away from this placement is the enjoyment I found in the workplace, workflow, and co-workers during my placement. Prior to this placement I was concerned that I am not ready to begin my career in software development and support. This placement experience has given me confidence that I am ready to graduate and enter the workforce.

                    Besides this boost to self-belief, this experience  also shows the importance of maintaining a friendly and cooptative atmosphere beyond the need for collaboration. Feeling safe to be able to approach each other gave plenty of chances to improve my skills, the project and the teamâ€™s ability to produce the product. A less friendly environment may very well result in less communication and growth as a team.                </p>

                    I have learnt a lot about the development life cycle and workplace environment during this placement that I will certainly continue to use throughout my future career. I will continue to use the collaborative tools learnt not only in team projects but also utilize them in personal solo projects to continue to improve my functionality with them. I will continue to work towards friendly relationships with my co-workers and maintain a good work environment.
                </p>
                <p class="font-l text-sky-100">
                    I will endeavour to continue to learn and develop my personal skills in areas that can be applied to future career opportunities beyond my time at Coding Labs. Besides improving the above skills, I will still need to work on other areas to improve my applicable skills, such as my experience with design, so I can make visual elements look better.

                <p class="font-l text-sky-100">
                    To greatly improve my collaborative skills, I will need to work on formatting code in a manner that is easier to work with others. My time with Coding Labs taught me this importance, as typically I have been a solo programmer before, I did not worry much about how my code is formatted. I will have to improve this to provide better collaborative code.
