                    My approach to learning has now changed throughout my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. As I have always been a physical learner, I applied the same practise to assessments and studies. This has worked well throughout my degrees as they have mostly been practical based work, allowing me to be an active learner and practise learn as I develop projects. While tasks have been greatly varied throughout my studies, the practical aspect of the courses has been a great asset to my development and knowledge and has greatly opened my future in many areas of further studies. I have many projects that I want to work on after graduation that I would consider a continuation of similar assessments and use knowledge gained throughout my studies.

                    I will continue to use the skills I have learnt throughout my studies, not only what was taught in the classes, but also my ability to actively learn that has continually improved throughout my years of study. I am certain with these I will develop further and achieve whatever personal and professional goals in my life and career.

                    In such a practical based career, this skill is a critical skill to have to be successful. While this has always been a focus of my learning pathway, my approach has changed a little since I started studies.  Early on I would just try to learn enough to get things working, however as I have continued, I have become more determined to understand how or why something is working. Instead of just grabbing code from stack overflow, I will persist to understand the code and hate to just copy and paste the code without understanding it. With this approach to learning, I have developed better understanding of how important  problem solving is. Both complex and creative problem solving is critical to a work environment, often the combination of them will create a better standard of results and continuing to improve them will greatly help my future career.

                    An area I found important in software development was getting a better understanding of regulations and codes. When I started study, I never thought of that side of software development, but as I continued through my studies and worked on multiple projects, I learnt the importance of understanding these. From a creative side, its important to understand  creative coms, what I can use from other people in certain ways. Such as using a game asset, I can use it for assessments without issues, but how the same asset cannot be used in a commercial project. Other areas that I wouldnâ€™t have thought of are things like privacy policies, how they need to meet certain requirements and can be easily missed. While still not my strong point, I understand the importance of knowing these regulations and codes to ensure that my future projects are safe and sound.
